    '''The Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points in a space.
    This method assumes that a and b are tuples or lists of two elements each, representing the x and y coordinates of each point.

    The @staticmethod decorator indicates that this method is a static method,
    which means it belongs to the class it's defined in, not any instance of that class.
    You can call it on the class itself, not on an instance of the class.

    The method uses the pow function to square the difference in x-coordinates and the difference in y-coordinates.
    The pow function takes two arguments: a base and an exponent, and returns the base raised to the power of the exponent.
    In this case, it's used to square the differences in coordinates (since squaring is the same as raising to the power of 2).

    The sqrt function is then used to take the square root of the sum of these squared differences,
    which gives the Euclidean distance between the two points.'''
